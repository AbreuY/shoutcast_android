        <li>SHOUTcast website, the APIs and SHOUTcast website Materials are controlled and operated
            within BELGIUM. Although SHOUTcast website is accessible from outside of BELGIUM, you
            understand and agree that SHOUTcast website, the APIs and SHOUTcast website Materials
            (a) have not been designed or customized for distribution for any specific Territory,
            (b) are not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any
            Territory where such distribution or use would be contrary to local law or regulation,
            (c) may not be appropriate or available for access or use in any particular Territory,

        </li>
        <li>You must register with RADIONOMY and provide accurate identification, contact, and other
            information required as part of the registration process. You may create a single
            account only. You may not create any script or other automated tool that attempts to
            create multiple developer accounts. We may in our sole discretion reject any
            registration for any reason.
        </li>
        <li>RADIONOMY may require that you obtain a user identification ("Developer ID") to use the
            certain APIs and SHOUTcast website Materials. RADIONOMY may, in its sole discretion,
            issue to You a Developer ID that You may be permitted to use for a variety of APIs and
            SHOUTcast website Materials, or RADIONOMY may require that You obtain a separate
            Developer ID for a specific application or material. Your Developer ID(s) will be
            uniquely associated with all versions, upgrades and updates of the Integrated Products
            created by You. Your Developer Product must at all times incorporate the applicable
            Developer ID in compliance with this Agreement and any additional usage rules that may
            apply to a specific API. You may not obtain a Developer ID under false pretenses,
            including without limitation, “spoofing” an IP address or misrepresenting any URLs that
            will incorporate an API. RADIONOMY has the right at all times to block attempts to
            access our networks with an invalid or revoked Developer ID or if an Integrated Product
            associated with a Developer ID exceeds the usage limits for a specific API. RADIONOMY,
            in its sole discretion, shall determine the number of unique Developer IDs that
            RADIONOMY provides to you. You may not share, loan, provide, transfer or sublicense your
            Developer ID to any other person or party. RADIONOMY has the right, in its sole
            discretion and without limiting our other legal remedies, to terminate any Developer ID
            and/or to prevent access to Its network. In addition to any other restrictions contained
            in this Agreement or in any applicable usage rule, You may not register for more than
            one Developer ID for each API. You may not use any additional Developer ID issued by
            RADIONOMY to You to circumvent any usage limits. You are responsible for (i) all
            activity under your Developer IDs and Developer Products, (ii) keeping your Developer ID
            confidential and (iii) notifying RADIONOMY immediately if you believe your Developer ID
            has been misappropriated. You agree to implement any feasible procedure that is or may
            become available to secure your Developer IDs from misuse by others. You will work with
            RADIONOMY immediately to correct any security deficiencies that may have been caused as
            a result of the misappropriation by any party of your Developer ID.
